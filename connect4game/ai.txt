I have some ideas that may make my AI smarter, but I didn't put them in my code.(AI in my HW12 will randomly make legal move)
There are two types of AI I come up with, the first one is attacking style, second one is defending style.
	For attackting style, AI will make its first move randomly, then scan the game board everytime before its play. If there are 2 in a row or 3 in a row, AI will drop its disk to make a higher connect based on the scan result. The priority is 3 in a row > 2 in a row > 1.
Attacting AI will not consider players move.
	For defending style, AI will scan the game board and alway block user's disk. The priority is also 3 in a row > 2 in a row > 1. If the higest priority choise don't have legal move, AI will choose second higest.
How AI scan the game board is very similar with how my program check user wins. The difference is AI not searching for connect 4, it will search connect 3 , connect 2 and single disk.
In future I may improve it by combine these two types AI together. The biggest problem is determine whitch style(attacting/defending) has higher priority in current round.
